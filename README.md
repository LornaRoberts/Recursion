# Recursion
Exercise from page 56, chapter 3 of 'Eloquent JavaScript.

Instructions: 

"We've seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it's divisible by tow. Here's another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

Zero is even. One is odd. For any other number N, it's evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.
